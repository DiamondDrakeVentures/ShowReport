- Monster HP changes should not pop up during session.
- Health descriptor: see if there's a manual switch.
- Aid.... Adding max HP is hard in Foundry. Need dynamic effects, I think?

Casts:
- Good job on being on time.
- Call out your rolls please.
- We’re speaking over each other again. Please watch out and curb your enthusiasm a tiny bit. Especially try hard to not talk over Clawsie.
- Please remember other people gets a chance to speak too, especially the quieter players. If you have spoken a lot and someone else who hasn’t begin a sentence as you are beginning your next one, consider backing down.
- Remember to keep tangents as text in #dnd-madness.
- Let’s remember to keep out of character comments to be mostly in #dnd-madness. Especially when it’s in response to RP conversations.
- Remember to describe actions instead of just implying them.
- Dial down the shenanigans. We do have time constraints. We do have strict deadlines.
- Please wait until after session to debrief combat. Again, time constraint.
- Please don't act on meta knowledge. If you see a monster healing in Foundry and the GM does not call attention to it, then no you don't.
- Please level up your character to level 5.
- For next session, there will be a big fight at the end of the session. Please try to be more concise where ever possible. 

Clawsie:
- If calling perception rolls during watches, it’s probably best to do them before RP moments. I don’t think you called for Kieran and Evan to roll perception. Nor did you call for Celine and Eve to roll perception.
- Please do what you need to do during the break. If your brain is imploding, it kind of doesn’t really matter how long or short a session is. It’s counterproductive when the GM is exploding.

Couch:
- Please continue to work on backing away from your mic when speaking in excitement.
- You were trailing off at the end of your sentences during rest time RP with Mariam. It’s a nice dramatic effect considering the subject matter, but stage whisper should apply here. Dramatic effects are not effects when you’re just inaudible. You also just go quieter randomly in general. Please try to remain within a consistent range.

Nova:
- Please pay attention to break timer. https://timer.diamonddrake.co. Alternatively, if you use a separate Chrome profile with your DDV account and you enable sync, the managed you should have a bookmark called “Production Timer” in the managed bookmarks folder.

Rowan:
- Good job on your RP! It's always difficult and anxiety inducing to RP conflicts with other player character, but you did an incredible job."

- Nova was out for food poisoning. Evran was played by Muu during combat and by the GM during RP.

Casts:
- Good job on not speaking over Clawsie. We’re definitely better this session.
- As always, we still need to work on not speaking over other players.
- Good job on being on time.
- Good job on remembering to call out your rolls. Let’s continue to remember that. Let’s also call out damage types.
- Great job on remembering we’re on stream.
- Let's avoid splitting up the party. It gets slower when we're all split up.
- When someone is doing an action that takes awhile, don't be afraid to jump in and have your character do something else in the mean time.

Clawsie:
- Bood jog combat.
- Good job on the recap.
- Remember that I’m here to support you during the production. Try to not explode when things are wrong. Simply alert me and I will fix them.
- Not sure what can be done here given your situation, but if possible, let’s try to not start late. We were only 2 minutes late though (see Stream Start time), so no biggie.
- Don’t be afraid to call session early when you’re running out of steam.
- If you're waiting to see if people are going to jump in, and no one is jumping in, don't be afraid to start asking if people want to do anything else. Also don't be afraid to move on.

Alex and Rowan:
- Please project your voice when speaking. Imagine as if you are on stage. Imagine your voice as a ray of light. You want it to hit the wall behind the audience, bounce back, and hit you again.

Couch:
- Remember to back away from your mic when speaking in excitement."

- Good job on your first combat! It was very engaging and gave a lot of character choice opportunities once we figured out the gimmick.
- Don’t forget to start the episode with a recap.
- Please callout break time. I don’t know when to start break when not called. It is not my place to do so.
- The first word of your sentences were cutting out somehow. Mostly after you’ve been silent for more than about 30 seconds.

Casts:
- Most of you came in on time. Good job!
- Please read out your final score whenever you roll. Stream does not see game chat.
- Speaking of stream, please do remember that we *are* on stream. It’s probably not a good idea to spam movements and pings to self stimuli.
- Please remember not to talk over each other. Especially when Clawsie is speaking."

Clawsie: ^ it’s especially important for you to do that, if you haven’t already.

Clawsie: if we’re going into intermission before we enter a scene (ie exiting the facility from today’s session), Foundry should be switched before we return on air. Alternatively, flip back to the welcome scene in Foundry.

Talents: when doing mic checks, please remember to speak in your character voice. Today was different because it’s our first session.

Ghi: fix hand of healing."
